# Language-Modelling (Generating english language with LSTM-RNN)

This model uses Long Short-term Memory recurrent neural networks to generate complex sequences with long-range structure, simply by predicting one data point at a time.

Here I have trained my model on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's:Sherlock Holmes and thus the model generates text similar to the writing of the author.
